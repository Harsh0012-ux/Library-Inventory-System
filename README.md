# Library Inventory System (Python OOP Project)

A modular and object-oriented **Library Inventory System** implemented in Python.  
This project simulates a real-world library by allowing users to add books, register members, borrow/return books, and store all data using JSON files for persistence.

---

## 📌 Features

### Core Operations
- Add new books to the library  
- Register library members  
- Borrow books (with availability checks)  
- Return borrowed books  
- View borrowed books per member  

### Data Persistence
- Automatically saves all books and member data to JSON  
- Loads saved data automatically when the system restarts  
- Handles missing or corrupted files using try-except  

### Analytics Report
Includes:
- Most borrowed book  
- Total number of active members  
- Number of books currently borrowed  

### Interactive User Menu
Provided through `main.py`:
